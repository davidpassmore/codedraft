[^4]: Moves budget meeting from December to November (to allow more time before end of fiscal year).

### Section 3

Special meetings of the Unit Owners may be called at any time after the annual meeting of the Unit Owners in 1979, for any purpose or purposes by the President, or by a majority of the Council or by not less than [ten]{style="color:red"} ~~twenty~~ percent[^5] ([10%]{style="color:red"} ~~20%~~) of all of the then Unit Owners entitled to vote at the meeting called. At any time upon written request of any person or persons entitled to call a special meeting, it shall be the duty of the Secretary to call the meeting of the Unit Owners entitled to vote therat, but no less than ten (10) nor more than fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the request. If the Secretary shall neglect or refuse to issue such call, the person or persons making the request may do so. All requests for special meetings shall be in writing and shall specify the purpose or purposes thereof. The business to be transacted at all special meetings shall be limited to the purpose or purposes set forth in the notice thereof and matters germane thereto.

[^5]: Reduces threshold for owners to call a special meeting from 20% to 10%.

### Section 4

Written notice of each meeting of the Unit Owners shall be given by or at the direction of the Secretary or other person authorized to call the meeting, by mailing a copy of such notice, postage prepaid, at least ten (10) days before such meeting to each Unit Owner entitled to vote thereat, addressed to the Unit Owner's address last appearing on the books of the Council or supplied by such Unit Owner to the Council for the purpose of notice. Such notice shall specify the place, day and hour of the meeting, and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose of meeting. [**Such notice shall be accompanied by a ballot through which each Unit Owner may vote on all questions to be decided by the meeting, whether or not they attend the meeting.**]{style="color:red"} If the said Unit Owner is a resident of Amberson Towers, it is sufficient compliance with this section to place the said notice [**and ballot**]{style="color:red"} in their mail box[^6] or deliver it to their Unit. [**If the said Unit Owner has consented to receive notification via electronic means, it is sufficient compliance with this section to deliver the notice via such means, and to deliver a ballot electronically immediately upon conclusion of the meeting.**]{style="color:red"}[^7]

[^6]: [*From Dona, 13 March 2022* - **It is illegal to put anything other than mail in a mailbox.** Therefore, it is illegal for a non-postal employee to place something in someone's mailbox.]{style="color:green"}

[^7]: Establishes voting subsequent to meetings, via paper and/or electronic voting, as we have been doing for the last 3 elections.

### Section 5

The president, or in his absence, the Vice-President, shall preside at all such meetings.

### Section 6

(a) [**Prior to the annual meeting and budget meeting, questions to be decided by the meeting shall be placed on the agenda pursuant to a vote of a majority of Council or petition by at least six**]{style="color:red"}[^8] <span style="color:red">Unit Owners holding ownership shares in at least six (6) different units. Petitions from owners must be submitted in writing to the Secretary no later than April 1 for consideration at the annual meeting or October 1 for consideration at the budget meeting. Upon receipt, petitions shall be distributed to the owners for comment and discussion. Council may recommend, but not require, that owners amend their petitions for clarity and/or consistency. Amended petitions must be submitted prior to the announcement of the meeting, for inclusion on the ballot.

(b) ~~At every meeting of the Unit Owners, each~~ [**Each**]{style="color:red"} Unit Owner --present , in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote thereat,-- shall have the right to cast the number of shares set forth opposite his Unit number in the [**Declaration**]{style="color:red"} ~~Schedule A~~. ~~The vote of fifty-one (51) percent of the number of votes represented and entitled to vote at such meeting shall decide any question brought before such meeting,~~ [**Voting shall take place subsequent to the meeting, via paper and/or electronic ballot, and shall remain open for 14 days.**</span>]{style="color:red"}[^9] Approval of any questions brought before such meeting shall require an affirmative vote of both a majority of shares voting and of 25% of total shares,[^10] unless the question is one upon which, by express provision or statute or of the Declaration or of this Code of Regulations, a different vote is required, in which case, such express provisions shall govern and control.

(c) If the owner of a unit is a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, trust, unincorporated association or other legal entity, the natural person who shall be entitled to cast the vote for such unit shall be the person named in a certificate executed by such entity pursuant to its governing documents. If the owner of a unit is a trust, the trustee or trustees shall be deemed to be the owner for the voting purposes. Where the ownership of a unit is in more than one person, the natural person who shall be entitled to cast the vote of such unit shall be the person named in a certificate executed by all of the owners of such unit and filed with the secretary. ~~or, in the absence of such named person from the or the failure to execute and file such a certificate, the person who shall be entitled to cast the vote of such unit shall be the person owning such unit who is present. If more than one of the multiple owners are present, the votes allocated to that unit may be cast only in accordance with their unanimous agreement. There shall be deemed to be unanimous agreement if any one of the multiple owners casts~~ ~~the votes allocated to that unit without protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of the other owners of the unit.~~ [**Such certificate may also be executed by any of the unit owners individually, if accompanied by an attestation that all the unit owners are in agreement, and shall be assumed to be valid if none of the other unit owners protest. Such certificate may be filed electronically, if digitally signed**]{style="color:red"}.[^11] Such certificate shall be valid until revoked by a subsequent certificate similarly executed. Subject to the provisions of the Declaration and Code of Regulations, wherever the approval or disapproval of a Unit Owner is required, such approval or disapproval shall be made only by the person who would be entitled to cast the vote of such unit at any meeting of the Association.

[^8]: Establishes a mechanism for referenda initiated by at least six owners, for inclusion on the ballot of the next meeting.

[^9]: [*from Dona, 13 March 2022* - is 14 days excessive for return of ballot? Shorter time limit means the issue won't be "put aside till later."]{style="color:green"}

[^10]: Establishes an affirmative quorum of 25% of total ownership shares for passage of any question.

[^11]: Requires that owners submit a certificate to indicate how they want to vote, and who will vote for units with multiple owners, or institutional owners.

### Section 7

(a) ~~Votes allocated to a unit may be cast pursuant to a proxy duly executed by a Unit Owner.~~ [**Votes allocated to a unit may be cast only by a natural person entitled to do so pursuant to Article IV, Section 6, and may not be cast via proxy, unless recognition of proxies is required by law,**]{style="color:red"}[^12] </span style="color:red">**in which case they will be utilized to the most limited extent required by law.**</span>[^13] If a unit is owned by more than one person, each owner of the unit may vote or register protest to the casting of votes by the other owners of the unit through a duly executed proxy. All proxies shall be in writing and shall be filed with the Secretary and by him entered of record in the minutes of the meeting.</span>[^14] [**Exercise of any proxy not entered into the minutes of the meeting shall be null and void, and any decision relying upon or influenced by such exercise shall also be null and void.**]{style="color:red"} A Unit Owner may appoint only another Unit Owner, [**who is a natural person**]{style="color:red"}, as his, her or its proxy.[^15] ~~If the owner of a unit is a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, trust, unincorporated association or other legal entity, the proxy may be issued to a natural person who is a fiduciary, an officer or who has an ownership interest in the legal entity.~~ [**No Unit Owners of any one unit may hold proxies issued by the owners of more than one other unit.**]{style="color:red"}[^16] If the proxy is issued by a Unit Owner who is a legal entity, the proxy shall be executed by a person duly authorized, accompanied by a notarized Acknowledgment that he/she is authorized to issue a proxy to the person named therein.

(b) All proxies are revocable at will, [**upon notice to the secretary, prior to distribution of ballots.**]{style="color:red"}[^17] ~~However, a Unit Owner may not revoke a proxy given pursuant to this section except by actual notice of revocation to the person presiding over a meeting of the association. A proxy is void if it is not dated or purports to be revocable without notice.~~ A proxy terminates one year after its date unless it specifies a shorter term. Proxies are not transferable and automatically terminate upon the death of, or the sale, transfer or conveyance of the Unit, by the maker of the proxy to another person.

[^12]: Restricts use of proxies to that required by law.

[^13]: [*from Dona, 13 March 2022* - You can allow proxies solely for the purpose of reaching quorum which seems to be an issue. The owner could still vote on questions or participate in the elections via email. <https://www.camsmgt.com/blog/making-meetings-count-how-to-reach-a-quorum-through-proxies> unless recognition of proxies is required by law-- I think we need to check with a lawyer and see if this is required in PA. If not, then take out this statement.]{style="color:green"}

[^14]: Requires that any proxies which are used be recorded in the minutes (not new, but the only time it was done was May 2021) and stipulates that if proxies are not recorded, the votes are not valid.

[^15]: Stipulates that proxies, if they are used at all, must be assigned to owners who are natural persons, not institutional owners.

[^16]: Limits each unit to holding proxies for at most one other unit.

[^17]: Makes it easier to revoke proxies by notice to the Secretary before ballots are distributed, rather than requiring notice in person at a meeting.

### Section 8

Either before or after any meeting, a Unit Owner may, in writing, waive notice of such meeting. Such waiver of notice in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Except in the case of a special meeting, neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, the meeting need be specified in the waiver of notice of such meeting.

### Section 9

Attendance of a Unit Owner, ~~either in person or by proxy,~~ at any meeting, or participation in voting subsequent to the meeting, shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a Unit Owner attend a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.[^18]

[^18]: Allows for online Council meetings

### Section 10

The number of Unit Owners having a ~~majority~~ [**25%**]{style="color:red"} of voting rights entitled to vote at any meeting,[^19] ~~present or by proxy,~~ shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. ~~If, however, such majority shall not be present or represented at any meeting, the Unit Owners entitled to vote thereat, present or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement of such meeting, until 20% of the votes in the Association shall be present or represented by proxy at the beginning of the adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted at the meeting as originally called.~~[^20]

[^19]: Increases quorum requirement for meeting from 20% to 25%, which is the minimum required to pass anything, if we adopt the affirmative quorum.

[^20]: Eliminates the possibility of adjourning a meeting and continuing to act as if the meeting was still in session. This has been abused, with meetings "adjourned" for months.

### Section 11

The meetings of owners shall be conducted in accordance with *Robert's Rules of Order* (latest edition). The purpose of the annual meeting is to receive reports of officers and committees, to elect members of Council, and conduct the transaction of any other business as may be brought before the meeting. The President of the Council/Association or, in his absence, the Vice President, shall act as chairperson and presiding officer at the annual meeting. The order of business at all annual meetings of the Unit Owners shall, unless otherwise determined by ~~the presiding officer or~~ action of the Unit Owners present[^21] ~~or represented~~ be as follows: [^22]

[^21]: Eliminates the possibility of the presiding officer changing the order of business without approval of the owners in attendance.

[^22]: Changes the order of business at annual and budget meetings to include substantive business.\

-   Roll call;\
-   Proof of notice of meeting or waiver of notice;\
-   ~~Reading of minutes of preceding meeting;~~\
-   Report of officers;\
-   Reports of committees;\
-   [Report of property manager;]{style="color:red"}\
-   ~~Appointment of inspectors of election by the president or chair person;~~\
-   [**Questions for candidates for Council (at the annual meeting)**]{style="color:red"} ~~Election of council;~~\
-   [**Questions concerning the budget proposal (at the budget meeting);**]{style="color:red"}\
-   [**Other items of business placed on the agenda.**]{style="color:red"}~~Unfinished business;~~\
-   ~~New business.~~

## ARTICLE V: Council

The Amberson Towers Condominium Association consists of all Unit Owners of Amberson Towers. The business and affairs of the Amberson Towers Condominium Association (a nonprofit corporation) shall be managed, administered and governed by a Council composed of Five (5) natural persons, who shall be Unit Owners [**residing in Amberson Towers**]{style="color:red"}[^23] [**and who shall have at least one year of residency in Amberson Towers. Any council member who ceases to be a resident shall thereby become ineligible for council membership; the resulting vacancy shall be filled by the procedures described in Article V, Section 4**]{style="color:red"}. ~~have an ownership interest in or are the trustees, partners, members, or officers of a Unit owned by a partnership, trust, corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity and who or which shall have been owners of a Unit and residents of Amberson Towers for at least one year prior to their election to the Council.~~ There may only be one (1) Council member from any one (1) Unit at any time. [**No Unit Owner shall be eligible for election to more than two full, consecutive terms as a member of Council.**]{style="color:red"} [^24] The officers of the Council shall also serve as the officers of the Amberson Towers Condominium Association.

[^23]: Reinstates requirement that members of Council must live in the building.

[^24]: Limits members of Council to two consecutive terms

Any council member who fails to attend and participate in three consecutive meetings of Council either in person, or by electronic means if such means is authorized by Council, without a medical excuse or other good cause, may, after notice and opportunity to be heard, be removed by the unanimous vote of all other Council members ~~in attendance at the meeting~~; the resulting vacancy shall be filled by the procedures described in Article V, Section 4. Electronic means is defined as attendance via telephone, video or audio conferencing, or other electronic device.

### Section 2

Each Council member named in the Declaration shall hold office until the annual meeting of the Unit Owners in the year 1979 or until his successor shall have been elected and qualified, which shall first occur.

### Section 3

At the annual meeting of the Unit Owners in the year 1979, the term of Office of Two (2) Council members elected shall be for three (3) years; and the term of office of Two (2) Council members shall be for Two (2) years; and the term of office of One (1) Council member elected shall be for One (1) year. The Council members receiving the largest number of votes shall serve the longest terms. At the expiration of the term of office of each respective Council member, his successor shall be elected to serve a term of Three (3) years. The Council member shall hold office until their successors have been elected and qualified.

In all elections of Council members, each Unit Owner shall [**rank the candidates in order of preference**]{style="color:red"}.[^25] [**Votes shall be tabulated by the method of single transferable vote, as described in Appendix A.**]{style="color:red"} ~~have the right, in person or by proxy, to multiply the number of votes to which he may be entitled by the number of directors to be elected and he may cast the whole number of said votes for one candidate or he may distribute them among any two or more candidates.~~

[^25]: Establishes use of ranked choice voting

### Section 4

Vacancies in the Council shall be filled by a [**unanimous vote**]{style="color:red"}[^26] ~~majority~~ of the remaining Council members and each person so elected shall be a Council member until his successor is elected by the Unit Owners, who may shall make such election at the next ~~annual~~ [**regular**]{style="color:red"} meeting of the Unit Owners or at any special meeting duly called for that purpose.

[^26]: Allows Council to fill vacancies only by unanimous vote, and only until the next regular meeting of the owners.

### Section 5

[^27] Any one or more of the Council members may be removed with or without cause by vote of ~~two-thirds of~~ the Unit Owners ~~entitled to vote at any duly held regular or special meeting of the Unit Owners, and a successor may be elected to fill the vacancy thus created.~~ [**following any duly held regular meeting or special meeting called for such a purpose. Such a motion must be made in advance of the meeting, for inclusion on the meeting ballot, pursuant to the provisions of ARTICLE IV, Section 6. Approval of a motion to remove a Council member shall require approval of 2/3 of shares voted and 1/3 of total shares.**]{style="color:red"}[^28] [**A vacancy thus created shall be filled according to the provisions of ARTICLE V, Section 4.**]{style="color:red"}

[^27]: [*from Dona, 13 March 2022* - is a unanimous vote necessary/always possible? With only 4 people voting it could be an issue if 2 candidates are suggested, and the vote is 2/2; but why is a 3/1 vote not acceptable? (Just asking. I'm assuming there's a reason.) Do we want to specify somewhere (and I may not have gotten there yet), that when voted on at the next meeting, who fills that slot is only serving the remainder of that members term? As with our current situation, there will be 2 three-year terms open, and the two-year remaining term of the Beth. If you don't do this, you'll screw up the 2-2-1 election cycle.]{style="color:green"}

[^28]: Establishes a 33% affirmative quorum for removal of Council members, and provides for the vote to be on paper and/or electronic.

### Section 6

~~No person shall receive any compensation for acting as a Council member but may receive compensation for services rendered to or for Amberson Towers in any other capacity.~~

[**No member of Council shall receive monetary or other compensation from the Association during their term in office.**]{style="color:red"}[^29]

[^29]: Disallows members of Council from receiving compensation of any kind from the Association during their term, including for other work. \*In Section 16, also, and Article VI, Section 10

The Council may exercise all such powers of Amberson Towers and may do all such acts and things, as are not by law or by this Code of Regulations directed or required to be exercised and done by the Unit Owners.

### Section 8

The Council shall require that all officers and employees handling its funds shall furnish fidelity bonds in such amounts as the Council shall determine. The premium on such bonds shall be paid by Amberson Towers.

### Section 9

The meetings of Council shall be conducted in accordance with Robert's Rules of Order (latest edition). Meetings of the Council shall be held at the principal office of Amberson Towers or at such place within the County of Allegheny as a majority of the Council may from time to time designate. [**With approval of a majority of Council, meetings may also be held by electronic means, including but not limited to telephone, video or audio conferencing, or other electronic device.**]{style="color:red"}

### Section 10

The first meeting of each new Council elected by the Unit Owners shall be held within thirty (30) days after such election upon at least five (5) days' written notice.

### Section 11

Regular meetings of the Council may be held at such time or times and place as shall be determined by a majority of the Council. Notice of regular meetings of the Council shall be given to each Council member personally [**or in writing, including via electronic means**]{style="color:red"} [^30] [**customarily in use**]{style="color:red"}~~, or by other or by mail or by telegram,~~ at least five (5) days prior to the day fixed for such meeting.

[^30]: Allows for electronic notice of special Council meetings; same in Section 12.

### Section 12

Special meetings of the Council may be called by the President on not less than five (5) days' notice to each Council member either personally [**or in writing, including via electronic means customarily in use**]{style="color:red"} ~~or by mail or by telegraph,~~ which notice shall state the time, place, and purposes of such meetings. Special meetings of the Council may also be called in like manner and upon like notice on the written request of at least three Council members.

### Section 13

Either before or after any meeting of the Council any Council member may, in writing, waive notice of such meeting and such waiver shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Attendance by a Council member at any meeting of the Council shall be a waiver by him of notice of the time and place thereof, unless said Council member has attended for the sole purpose of objecting to the meeting. If all the Council members are present at any meeting of the Council, except for the purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business for good and lawful cause, no notice shall be required and any business may be transacted at such meeting.

### Section 14

At all meetings of the Council, a majority of the Council members in office shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.[^31] ~~, and the acts of the majority of the Council members present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the acts of the Council. If, at any meeting of the Council, there be less than a quorum present, the majority of those present may adjourn the meeting from time to time. At any such adjourned meeting, any business which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called may be transacted without further notice.~~ [**Council members must be present, in person or by electronic means, to record a vote, and may not indicate a vote in advance of the meeting.

[**Such action shall be immediately announced to the Unit Owners, and shall be included in the minutes of the subsequent Council meeting.**]{style="color:red"} [^33]

[^33]: Requires notice to owners if Council takes any action outside of a meeting.

### [Section 16 is DELETED]{style="color:red"}

[^34]~~The Council members, by resolution adopted by the majority of the entire Council, may at any time elect two (2) or more of their number as an executive committee which shall, in the intervals between meetings of the Council, exercise such powers and perform such duties as may from time to time be prescribed by the Council. Unless otherwise authorized by the Council, such committee shall act by unanimous vote of its members at a meeting or by a writing signed by all its members. Any act or thing done by such committee within the scope of the power delegated to it, shall be as effective for all purposes as the act or authorization of the Council. The committee shall keep regular minutes of its proceedings and shall report to the Council all actions taken by it.~~

[^34]: Section 16 deleted. Eliminates possibility of Council appointing executive committee between meetings. This is never done in practice, and it creates opportunities for abuse.

### Section 1~~7~~[6]{style="color:red"}

[^35]The Council shall have the following powers and duties in addition to those vested in it under the law, the Declaration and this Code of Regulations:

[^35]: Section renumbered

(d) To appoint, employ and remove at any time any agent, or employee; and to prescribe the duties of and fix the compensation for any agent or employee. Nothing contained in this Code of Regulations shall be construed to prohibit the employment of any Unit Owners~~, Officers or Council Members~~ [**who are not members of Council,**]{style="color:red"} in any capacity whatsoever;\
(e) To exercise for Amberson Towers all powers, duties, and authority vested in or delegated to it which it may lawfully exercise, in carrying out or in furtherance of its purposes or any of them;\
(f) To submit ~~at each annual meeting of the~~ to the Unit Owners a statement of the operations of Amberson Towers during the preceding year, together with a report of its general financial condition. Copies of such annual financial reports shall be sent to each Unit Owners within sixty (60) days following the close of the preceding fiscal year, along with a copy to the Mortgagee of any Unit who has requested the same in writing; the said mortgagees can also examine the books and records of the condominium;\
(g) To make or cause to be made a proposed budget for the ensuing year, a copy of which shall be mailed to each Unit Owner at least ten (10) days prior to the ~~annual~~ budget meeting.\
(h) To elect all officers and to fill all vacancies which may occur.

[^36]: Allows owners to change rules made by Council with a majority vote, rather than 60%.

## ARTICLE VI: Officers

The officers of the Council and Amberson Towers Condominium Association shall be a president and a vice-president, a secretary and a treasurer, and such other officers as the Council may create by resolution from time to time.

No person shall serve as the president or vice president unless he/she has served on Council for at least one (1) year prior to their election.

[^38]: [*from Dona, 13 March 2022* - does the treasurer really have custody of funds and securities, and is responsible for disbursement? Again, I thought that's part of what we were paying Meyers Mgmt to do.]{style="color:green"}

## ARTICLE VII: Payment of Common Expenses and Other Expenses by Unit Owners

### Section 1

As provided in Article V, Section 17, the Council shall determine all matters relating to maintenance, repair and replacement of the common elements and also all matters relating to the common expenses.

### Section 2

The Council shall pro-rate all costs involved in Section 1 above, among all the Unit Owners in proportion to their ownership in the common elements, provided, however, that if any cost is occasioned by the negligence of any unit owner or owners, said costs shall be borne by said unit owner or owners.

### Section 3

The total amount of the charges required for each calendar year shall be estimated by the Council at least one (1) month prior to the beginning of each calendar year. Such estimate may include an amount for unanticipated or under-estimated costs, charges and expenses and deficits incurred in any prior year or years, and may further include amounts to be accumulated in any reserve funds for expenditures which may be required in future years for other than ordinary current maintenance, repairs, costs and expenses. The first such charge may be estimated and made for less than a full year, and in such event the Maintenance Charge for such period shall be payable in equal monthly installments for the remainder of such calendar year, beginning on the first day of the month immediately following the determination of such estimate by the Council. Thereafter, each annual Maintenance Charge shall be payable in twelve (12) equal monthly installments beginning on the first day of January of each calendar year.

Any judgment against a unit and its owners shall be enforceable in the same manner as is otherwise provided by law.

[^40]: Is this a typo?

[^41]: Is this a legal term or incorrect spelling?

Until the Council shall otherwise determine, the monthly charges to be paid by each Unit Owner shall be in accordance with the budget attached.

### Section 4

In the event that the Council decides that additional monies are required in addition to those set forth in the annual budget, ~~the Council shall give the Unit Owners at least Thirty (30) days written notice of the total monies required and allocate amounts among the Unit Owners together with time for payment of said proportionate amounts which may be at one time or in installments, as the Council decides, provided, however, that if Unit Owners representing forty (40%) percent of the votes of Amberson Towers object in writing to said additional assessments within fifteen (15) days after mailing of such notice,~~ the Council shall call a special meeting of the Unit Owners for the purpose of obtaining approval of said assessments, at which meeting the assessments of the Council must receive the same affirmative vote as in the case of the annual budget. [^42]

[^42]: Requires same approval for special assessments as for the budget. Previously, Council could enact special assessments and the owners could cancel them, but the threshold was unrealistic.

These policies shall be reviewed once a year and increased as necessary to provide maximum coverage. Such insurance shall be obtained in the name of the Council as Trustee for all of the owners and their mortgagees, as their interest appears.

(b) A policy or policies of insurance insuring the Council and all of the Unit Owners against any liability to the public or to the Unit Owners, their invitees, guests, and tenants, incident to the ownership and use of the common elements and the units; the liability under such policies shall be not less than One Million (\$1,000,000) Dollars for any one accident, and One Hundred Thousand (\$100,000) Dollars for property damage, and such policy limits shall be reviewed at least every three (3) years by the Council and may be increased in its discretion.

### Section 1: Sale or Lease by Unit Owner

Any owner who wishes to sell ~~, lease, or rent~~ his unit shall, at least ([seven]{style="color:red"} ~~thirty~~ (([7]{style="color:red"} ~~30~~) days prior to accepting any offer to sell~~, lease or rent,~~ give Council written notice of the terms of such offer, which notice shall specify the name and address of the offeror. If, within the said [**seven**]{style="color:red"} ~~thirty~~ ([**7**]{style="color:red"}~~30~~) day period,[^43] time being of the essence, Council or its nominee submits to the owner an identical or more favorable offer to sell~~, lease, or rent,~~ the selling owner must accept the offer of said Council in preference to the original offer described in the notice. In the event Council fails to submit in writing to the selling owner an identical or more favorable offer within [**seven**]{style="color:red"} ~~thirty~~ ([**7**]{style="color:red"}~~30~~) days of receipt of notice of the selling owner's offer, time being of the essence, then the selling owner may sell his apartment to his original offeror. In any event, Council, shall have sole discretion in this matter and no vote or approval of the Unit Owners is required. Any holder of a mortgage which comes into possession of a unit pursuant to the remedies provided in the mortgage or any purchaser at a sheriff sale of the unit or any mortgages, or its designee, who accepts a deed for the unit in lieu of foreclosure shall be exempt from the provision of this section.[^44]

[^43]: Reduced time Council has for right of first refusal of sale from 30 to 7 days.

[^44]: [*from Dona, 13 March 2022* - I don't get this! Why would Council want to buy a unit and where would they get the money? I'm pretty sure when we made the offer on our apartment, Council was not involved at all. And what about having to get a waiver so only 10% of units can be rentals? Owners can't just decide they want to lease their unit and just notify Council of who the renter will be, can they? I've never fully understood the lottery system for being allowed to rent. (And how can someone [or an LLC] own an apartment solely for rental purposes? How would they be guarantee annually that "win" the lottery?)]{style="color:green"}

[**Any owner who wishes to lease or rent his unit shall, prior to accepting any offer to lease or rent, give Council written notice of the terms of such offer, which notice shall specify the name and address of the offeror. Approval of Council, or of an agent designated by Council to issue such approval, shall be required before such an agreement to lease or rent can be executed. Council shall have sole discretion in the matter of approving or rejecting rental or lease agreements, and shall not be liable to any owner such action.**]{style="color:red"}[^45]

[^45]: Eliminates requirement that Council compensate owners if a lease is not approved

### Section 2: Lease Restrictions

(a) Leasing of Units is permitted only as provided herein.

(b) It is the policy of the Condominium Association to discourage the purchase of Condominium units solely for investment (i.e., where the Purchaser does not intend to occupy the unit). To implement this policy, no unit may, where acquired by purchase, be rented to a tenant before one year has elapsed since the date of purchase, unless the tenant is a member of the Purchaser's immediate family as herein defined or the Condominium Council determines in advance that the rental of the Unit to the proposed tenant will not violate the general policy. If the unit is rented on the date of purchase, the lease then in effect remains valid and the year referred to the above shall begin at the expiration of the lease. "Immediate Family" consists of the Purchaser's spouse, parents, grandparents, step-parents, brothers, sisters, children, step-children, grandchildren, ~~nieces and nephews,~~ and the same relations of the spouse of the Purchaser.[^46] This policy shall apply to all purchases of units taking place thirty (30) days or more after this provision has gone into effect.

(c) Commencing January 1, 2001, the maximum number of Units that may be leased at any one time is twenty(20). A lease between family members shall not be counted as a leased Unit.

(d) A Tenant occupying a Unit under a lease from the Unit Owner may not sublease or assign the Unit under any circumstances.

(e) Between April 1, 1996 and January 1, 2001, leases that were in effect as of March 31, 1996 may continue to their date of termination and may be renewed if to the same resident tenant.

(f) After April 1, 1996, any new leases must have the written approval of Council before it they will be valid. It is the intent of Council to reduce the number of leases between April 1, 1996 and January 1, 2001 so that the maximum number of leased Units on January 1, 2001 will be twenty (20).

(g) If at any time the approved number of leased Units in Amberson Towers falls below the leasing cap of twenty (20) Units, Council may grant additional number of leasing permits to reach, but not to exceed, the leasing cap number of twenty (20) Units in the building. All new leasing permits shall be good for one year only and all leases entered thereunder shall be for a lease term of no less nor more than one year and not renewable. Grandfathered Unit Owners as are defined below who are leasing their Units shall be counted toward this twenty (20) Unit leasing cap. Council is granted the authority to establish rules and regulations to include a system for selecting Unit Owners who will be permitted to lease their Units, and such other rules and regulations as it deems necessary from time to time for the proper administration and management of leasing in the building. Unit Owners who are permitted to lease their units shall not be required to pay rental fees to the Association. In any rules and regulations that it may adopt, Council may grant leasing preferences to Unit Owners based on their seniority as owners of Units in the building. No Unit Owner shall be approved to lease his Unit unless he has resided in the Unit for one continuous year. Those Unit Owners who were leasing their Units prior to May 15, 1996 with the approval of Council~~, or were given the right by Council to lease their units as settlement of a legal dispute with Council,~~ [^47] are hereby grandfathered and may continue to lease their Units without any limitation on the length or the number of leases or renewals, except that no lease shall be for a term of less than one (1) year. [**The status of any unit as grandfathered shall terminate upon sale or transfer of the unit to new owners.**]{style="color:red"}[^48]

(h) Renting of any Unit on Airbnb or similar online marketplace and hospitality service that enables people to lease or rent short-term lodging, is strictly prohibited. This applies to Unit Owners who rent their Units for a term of less than one year, irrespective of whether they are permitted to lease their Units or not.

[^46]: Eliminates nieces and nephews from category of immediate family members (was changed in 2017)

[^47]: Eliminates special treatment of parties to a legal settlement

[^48]: Clarifies that grandfathering of units only lasts until the unit is sold or transferred

### Section 3

Except as noted below, no person, partnership, trust, corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity may be an owner of more than two Units, whether directly, indirectly, in whole or in part.

Exceptions are as follows:

(a) This regulation shall not prevent any licensed lending agency or mortgage holder holding mortgages on more than two units from acquiring them by Sheriffs Sale in the event of default. Multiple ownership via this process shall be regarded as temporary, pending sale.

(b) Acquisition of Units through legal inheritance or marriage.

(c) In other special cases upon the unanimous approval of Council.

### Section 4

(a) Occupancy of any unit must include at least one person over 21 years of age [**and may not include unrelated persons unless all are over 21 years of age.**]{style="color:red"} [^49]

[^49]: Clarifies that units may not be occupied by unrelated individuals under the age of 21. Previous language was unclear ("Where units are owned by parents for occupancy by sons and/or daughters, occupancy must include the sons and/or daughters of the owners.")

~~(b) Where units are owned by parents for occupancy by sons and/or daughters, occupancy must include the sons and/or daughters of the owners.~~

(b) If the Unit Owner is a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, trust, or other legal entity, the natural person(s) who will occupy the Unit must have some relationship to the entity such as being a member, shareholder, owner or officer of a corporation or limited liability company, a partner in the partnership, a beneficiary of the trust, or a family member of any of the foregoing natural persons as defined in Section 2 of this Article.[^50]

[^50]: [*from Dona, 13 March 2022* - So 119 owned by HHI Properties, 217 Equity Trust, and 115 and 719 Paul & Jane Nakazato Revocable Trust can only be leased only be leased to someone with a connection to those groups?]{style="color:green"}

### Section 5

[^52]: *from Dona, 13 March 2022* - Why is this necessary? How can an owner object to the correction of a typo, and why would they need 60 days to make their objections known? Maybe I'm reading this wrong, but it doesn't make sense to me.</span>

    1. Flexibility to no longer require white curtains, as log as window coverings visible from public areas are not offensive.\
    2. Flexibility to allow hardwood or laminate floors, as long as high quality sound insulation is used.  3. More specific regarding insurance policies, and allows Council to set minimum policy limits.

Under no circumstances shall it be permissible to bring or keep such animals in or about the building if they are vicious or aggressive or cause a nuisance or hazard of any kind, including but not limited to noise, odor, and/or unhealthful conditions.**]{style="color:red"}[^54]\

[^54]: [*From Dona, 13 March 2022* - Didn't we discuss this at our meeting and decide that no animals should mean no animals, unless they are service animals which are already allowed? Pet owners don't ever think their animals are a nuisance, just like parents don't believe that of their children. I just don't think we want to allow wiggle room on the no pet policy.]{style="color:green"}

[^55]: [*from Dona, 13 March 2022* - "minimum Impact Insulation Class (IIC) and Sound Transmission Class (STC) ratings and other standards or requirements as shall be established by Council." Has this been established somewhere, and is it in writing? Most people don't have any idea about this stuff, and flooring salesmen may offer suggestions that don't meet the requirements. This needs to be spell out somewhere if it's going to be a rule.]{style="color:green"}

## [ARTICLE XIX: **Open Meetings and Meeting Records**]{style="color:red"}

### [Section 1: Election Committee]{style="color:red"}

[All elections and votes of the Association shall be administered by an election committee composed of five natural persons, who are Unit Owners.]{style="color:red"} [^58]

[^58]: Established new procedures and standards for conduct of elections and votes.\
    0. Establishes election committee, nominated by unanimous vote of Council, prior to budget meeting, for 1 year term.\
    1. Inspector of Election chosen by election committee. May not serve consecutive terms.\
    2. Members may be removed by unanimous vote of other members and majority of Council. Vacancies filled by unanimous vote of Council.\
    3. Requires open meetings of election committee, public comment on election methods, and establishes standards\
    -- Voting must be by paper and/or electronic ballot, with all having equal chance to vote.\
    -- Votes must be secret.\
    -- Ballots must be protected from duplication, alteration of destruction\
    -- List of units voting must be published with results\
    4. Requires Council to remain neutral in elections\
    -- Council may not endorse candidates or ballot questions outcomes (but individual members of Council may do so)\
    -- Members of Council who are candidates may not vote on election related questions.\
    -- Council shall not discourage owners from communicating with each other, or voicing their views\
    -- If communication channels controlled by the Association are used, there must be equal access.\
    5. Employees and contractors may not take part in the conduct of elections.\
    6. If candidates feel the election is not free fair, they have the right to request that it be conducted by a professional, disinterested party, if they pay the cost.

[Members of the election committee shall be nominated by unanimous vote of the Council prior to the annual budget meeting. Each election committee must include at least two members who did not serve during the previous term. Members of Council may not simultaneously serve on the election committee.]{style="color:red"}

[The vote at each budget meeting will be administered by the election committee nominated during the previous year. Each new election committee will oversee the vote at the following annual meeting, the subsequent budget meeting, and any other intervening votes.]{style="color:red"}

### [Section 2: Inspector of Election]{style="color:red"}

[The election committee shall choose one of its members, by majority vote, to serve as Inspector of Election. The Inspector of Election shall chair meetings of the election committee and coordinate its activities. The election committee may, at any time, by majority vote, appoint a new member of the committee as Inspector of Election.]{style="color:red"}

[No Unit Owner shall serve consecutive terms as Inspector of Election.]{style="color:red"}

### [Section 3: Vacancies and Removal of Members]{style="color:red"}

[A member of the election committee may be recommended for removal by a unanimous vote of the other members of the election committee, which must be ratified by a majority vote of the Council.]{style="color:red"}

[In the event of a vacancy on the election committee, the Council shall appoint a replacement, by unanimous vote, to fill the remainder of the vacated term.]{style="color:red"}

### [Section 4: Meetings and Election Methods]{style="color:red"}

[The election committee shall hold open meetings, shall publish a description of the election method it intends to employ, and shall provide an opportunity for public comment prior to adoption.]{style="color:red"}

[Election methods adopted by the election committee must satisfy the following criteria:]{style="color:red"}\

-   [All Unit owners must have an equal opportunity to vote, via paper ballot or electronically, without the requirement to attend a meeting in person as a condition of voting.]{style="color:red"}\
-   [It must be possible for Unit Owners to vote in a manner that maintains the secrecy of their vote.]{style="color:red"}\
-   [It must not be possible for ballots to be duplicated, falsified or discarded without detection.]{style="color:red"} 
-   [It must be possible to determine which Unit Owners have voted on any question, and the list of Unit owners who have voted must be published as part of the election results.]{style="color:red"}[^59]

[^59]: [*from Dona, 13 March 2022* - Since the election "method" worked for the past election, and no flaws were discovered, why doesn't that become the "method" employed by future committees? There may be folks who would like to serve on the committee to oversee the process and tabulate the ballots, who do not have any real expertise in how elections can be run. Maybe this can be worded that allows the committee to present new ideas as new technology may become available, but I can't see why the committee would need to come up with a different way to handle elections since we're confident the last way worked.]{style="color:green"}

### [Section 5: Neutrality of Council]{style="color:red"}

(a) [The Council shall remain neutral in all elections and votes, and shall not, as a body, endorse any candidate or take a position on any question. This shall not preclude any members of Council from voicing their own personal opinions or making endorsements.]{style="color:red"}\

(b) [No member of Council who is a candidate in any election shall vote on any question pertaining to that election.]{style="color:red"}\

(c) [The Council also shall not take any action with the intent or effect of dissuading individual Unit Owners from communicating freely with each other and voicing their opinions on any candidate or question being voted upon. This includes but is not limited to making use of electronic forums made generally available to all Unit Owners, distribution of letters or handouts to individual units, or posting notices on bulletin boards or in other common areas customarily made available for posting notices, with the exception that individual Unit Owners who request to opt out of having election related materials distributed to the units shall have their wishes respected.]{style="color:red"}

(d) [No communication channel controlled by the Association which is not generally available to all shall be used for purposes of promoting candidates or positions on ballot questions, other than distribution of reminders to vote, unless it is made equally available to all candidates and to both proponents and opponents of ballot questions.]{style="color:red"}

### [Section 6: Neutrality of Employees and Contractors]{style="color:red"}

[No employee or contractor of the Association shall participate in any way in the conduct or administration of any election or vote, except to provide clerical assistance at the request of the Inspector of Election. This includes but is not limited to the design and preparation of ballots, the collection of ballots or proxies, and/or the counting of ballots.]{style="color:red"}

[This shall not apply to a professional, disinterested party hired by the Association solely for the purpose of administration of an election, who has no other financial interest or other conflict of interest.]{style="color:red"}

### [Section 7: Announcement of Election Results]{style="color:red"}

[Upon certification of the results of any election or vote, the results will be announced by the election committee to the Unit Owners and published on the website for a minimum of three years. Announcement of the results shall include a list of units that participated in the vote.]{style="color:red"}

### [Section 8: Rights of Candidates]{style="color:red"}

[If any candidate for office, or any Unit Owner who is a proponent or opponent of any ballot question, believes that the election or votes is not being conducted in a free and fair manner, they shall have the option of requiring that the election or vote be administered by a professional, disinterested party mutually agreeable to all Unit Owners exercising this prerogative and to the election committee. The Unit Owners exercising this prerogative shall be responsible for paying any additional cost to the Association.]{style="color:red"}

### <span style="color:red"> Section 9: Dispute Resolution</spam>

[Any disputes regarding elections or votes shall be resolved via the alternative dispute resolution process established by Council pursuant to ARTICLE XVIII.]{style="color:red"}
